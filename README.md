# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

The Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is a web application that allows you to visualize various sorting algorithms in action. It provides an interactive way to understand and compare the efficiency of different sorting methods.

## Features
Visualize sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and more.
Step through the sorting process to see how data is rearranged.
Customize the input data size and speed of visualization.
Gain insights into the time complexity and performance of different algorithms.


## Usage
To use the Sorting Algorithm Visualizer, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Open the index.html file in a web browser.

Choose a sorting algorithm from the available options.

Adjust the input data size and visualization speed as needed.

Click the "Start" or "Visualize" button to see the sorting algorithm in action.

Observe how the algorithm rearranges the data and gain insights into its performance.

Experiment with different algorithms and settings to compare their efficiency.

## Sorting Algorithms
The visualizer currently supports several sorting algorithms, including:

* Bubble Sort
* Quick Sort
* Merge Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Selection Sort
